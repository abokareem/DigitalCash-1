Today is the day, the day that we have all been waiting for. To finish the Final Project in Crypto. 

It will be a day we remeber for the rest of our lives. 

All of the blood sweat and tears of the scars and bruises we have developed over the last 12 weeks. 

It will be glorius, but it will be a fight.
